# FLO-Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction

Facebook recently introduced what's called "maximum bidding". introduced a new type of bidding, "average bidding," as an alternative to the bidding type.

One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
